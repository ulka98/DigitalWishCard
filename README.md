### Wish someone special happy birthday in a special way.

#### [See it Live](https://ulka98.github.io/DigitalWishCard/)

#### This code has been forked from this repository [https://github.com/faahim/happy-birthday] with a few changes.
#### As a begineer in Front-end I found playing around with the code highly restictive as the animation library used was unknown to me. I faced issues with changing the background and customizing the grapics or transition. If you love the animations and transitions the way they already are then it is a great repo, just change the wordings and you are done. However, if you want to add more of your animations, like i wanted to, it is difficult as a begineer.
Happy wishing! ðŸŽ‰
